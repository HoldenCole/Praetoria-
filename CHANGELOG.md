# Changelog

All notable changes to Praetoria. The format follows Keep a Changelog; versions follow SemVer with 1.0 = the
Build Spec's V1 ("a complete human game").

## [0.5.0] — 2026-11-07 — "headless complete"
See `docs/RELEASE_0.5.md` for the full notes.

### Added
- Save/load (`SaveSystem`, versioned envelope; `play --save/--load`).
- `track` and `era` conditions; `revokeClaim` and `succeed` effects; `{role.rankName}` token.
- Career ladders as data (`/content/careers`) with rank caps.
- Crisis `once` and `onResolve`.
- Stress bleed-off and break point (`broken`, `breakdowns`); regency flag; ironman vs continue mode (`--continue`).
- Population → Manpower with per-specialization ceilings; NPC houses invest in their domains.
- Scenario `the_imperial_court` (Imperium start); starting `flags` on scenario characters; married casts.
- 14 events: *The Favor Called*, *The Slighted Kinsman*, *The Frame Unravels*, three Imperial-court events, eight "echoes".
- CI runs the Python pre-flight validator; both validators reject events with no ungated choice.
- `version` command; `World.IsDynastyDead`; relationship index.

### Fixed
- Career events fired for the wrong track; ranks ran past the ladder top.
- Marriages authored from one spouse never produced heirs.
- The run continued after dynasty death.
- Four events had every choice gated and were re-offered forever.
- `press_the_claim` never spent its claim; `the_abdication` demoted the player's own house.
- `first_case/rule_by_favor` cleared `owes_you` instead of arming it; `the_marked_man/finish_it` killed no one.
- `realm_unstable` / `civil_war_active` never cleared.
- Content guide drift; duplicate upload artifacts at the repo root.

## [0.4] — 2026-06 — engine branch (pre-versioning)
Milestones 1, 2, 4 (economy), 5 and the dynasty lifecycle, headless. See `docs/MILESTONE_*_NOTES.md`.
