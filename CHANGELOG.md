# Changelog

All notable changes to Praetoria. The format follows Keep a Changelog; versions follow SemVer with 1.0 = the
Build Spec's V1 ("a complete human game").

## [0.6.0-alpha] — Unreleased — "the Court opens"
### Added
- **Godot layer (Milestone 3, first draft):** `GameRoot` (top bar, Court/Galaxy toggle, End Turn, Save, Load),
  `CreationScreen`, `CourtView` (advisors · briefing feed · dynasty rail / crisis clock / chronicle),
  `GalaxyView` + `GalaxyMap` (drawn node-and-lane map, territory by accent, click to inspect),
  `CourtTheme` (era-reactive palette). Compiles against Godot.NET.Sdk 4.3; **not yet run in an editor**.
- **Galaxy model**: `/content/galaxy` (systems + lanes), `World.Galaxy`, holdings placed in systems in every
  scenario, derived territory, neighbours/hops, `GalaxyProjection`; `map` command.
- **Character creation**: `/content/traits` (vocabularies as data), `/content/backgrounds` (six origins),
  `CharacterCreation` with validation; `create` command and `play --name/--sex/--background/--nature/--aptitude/--track/--ambition`.
- CI compiles the Godot layer.
- **Fleets (first layer)**: `Fleet`/`FleetIntel` state, `FleetSystem` (transit, readiness, upkeep, incursions, intel),
  `MoveFleetCommand` / `RaiseFleetCommand`, `/content/fleets/rules.json`, scenario `fleets`, `fleetStrength`
  condition, NPC houses raise and sail, `GalaxyProjection.Fleets`; two fleet events (*Unfamiliar Sails*, *The Review*).
- **`CourtProjection`**: the Godot-free, tested model of everything Court mode shows; `CourtView` renders it.
- UI: Admiral panel, ship-laying buttons, fleet glyphs and movement orders on the map, serif/sans typography,
  portrait badge slot. NPC action pools gain one Treasury point a turn (fleet orders).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-11-07 — "headless complete"
See `docs/RELEASE_0.5.md` for the full notes.

### Added
- Save/load (`SaveSystem`, versioned envelope; `play --save/--load`).
- `track` and `era` conditions; `revokeClaim` and `succeed` effects; `{role.rankName}` token.
- Career ladders as data (`/content/careers`) with rank caps.
- Crisis `once` and `onResolve`.
- Stress bleed-off and break point (`broken`, `breakdowns`); regency flag; ironman vs continue mode (`--continue`).
- Population → Manpower with per-specialization ceilings; NPC houses invest in their domains.
- Scenario `the_imperial_court` (Imperium start); starting `flags` on scenario characters; married casts.
- 14 events: *The Favor Called*, *The Slighted Kinsman*, *The Frame Unravels*, three Imperial-court events, eight "echoes".
- CI runs the Python pre-flight validator; both validators reject events with no ungated choice.
- `version` command; `World.IsDynastyDead`; relationship index.

### Fixed
- Career events fired for the wrong track; ranks ran past the ladder top.
- Marriages authored from one spouse never produced heirs.
- The run continued after dynasty death.
- Four events had every choice gated and were re-offered forever.
- `press_the_claim` never spent its claim; `the_abdication` demoted the player's own house.
- `first_case/rule_by_favor` cleared `owes_you` instead of arming it; `the_marked_man/finish_it` killed no one.
- `realm_unstable` / `civil_war_active` never cleared.
- Content guide drift; duplicate upload artifacts at the repo root.

## [0.4] — 2026-06 — engine branch (pre-versioning)
Milestones 1, 2, 4 (economy), 5 and the dynasty lifecycle, headless. See `docs/MILESTONE_*_NOTES.md`.
