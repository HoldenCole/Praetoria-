# Changelog

All notable changes to Praetoria. The format follows Keep a Changelog; versions follow SemVer with 1.0 = the
Build Spec's V1 ("a complete human game").

## [0.7.0-alpha] — Unreleased — "Blood and Iron"
Twenty-odd systems in one autonomous pass. Everything headless is tested (224 tests); the UI additions compile.

### Military
- Ship classes as data (corvette → battleship; attack/defense/cost/upkeep; title-rank and specialization gates);
  fleet composition; losses fall screen-first. Admirals (assign command; skill and traits multiply power; victory
  teaches, defeat wounds or kills). Veterancy. Sieges with a blockade clock that halves yield. War score →
  tribute and peace refusal; war weariness. Titles follow the land (a landless house loses its rank; the conqueror
  gains a claim). Merge fleets.
### Dynasty
- Children named from house cultures; coming of age with inherited traits, a track, skills and an ambition.
  Succession laws (primogeniture, ultimogeniture, seniority, merit). Fostering hides kin from events and knives.
  Assassination with odds, trails and consequences; NPC heir-hunting in war. Marriage proposals (claims from
  marrying up); NPC courtship. Real regents. Resentment of the risen (`parvenu`).
### Strategy & endgame
- The Exchange, tax policy, territory contiguity, megastructures (title-gated), the difficulty knob. Proclaim or
  seize the Imperium (era flip, office fleets pass, the deposed house marked). The saga epilogue. Director: one
  set-piece per briefing, ambition-weighted events, lull-driven complications.
### Character
- Honorifics & Orders (five, condition/effect lists). Nature-trait friction: stress for acts against your nature.
### Content
- 17 new events (90 total): coming of age, the regent, the old blood, the knife turned, the plot exposed, the
  great work, the butcher's bill, the conquered world, the lost world, the envoy, the proclamation, the wedding
  feast (a Bloody Event), and more; 14 events tagged with ambitions; two name cultures; six backgrounds.
### UI (compiles; unrun)
- Shipyard per holding by class; command and merge of fleets; siege clocks on the map and in the Admiral panel;
  tax, exchange, succession law, throne and intrigue actions; foster/recall; dynasty tree overlay; difficulty at
  creation; the epilogue card.

## [0.6.0-alpha] — "the Court opens"
### Added
- **Godot layer (Milestone 3, first draft):** `GameRoot` (top bar, Court/Galaxy toggle, End Turn, Save, Load),
  `CreationScreen`, `CourtView` (advisors · briefing feed · dynasty rail / crisis clock / chronicle),
  `GalaxyView` + `GalaxyMap` (drawn node-and-lane map, territory by accent, click to inspect),
  `CourtTheme` (era-reactive palette). Compiles against Godot.NET.Sdk 4.3; **not yet run in an editor**.
- **Galaxy model**: `/content/galaxy` (systems + lanes), `World.Galaxy`, holdings placed in systems in every
  scenario, derived territory, neighbours/hops, `GalaxyProjection`; `map` command.
- **Character creation**: `/content/traits` (vocabularies as data), `/content/backgrounds` (six origins),
  `CharacterCreation` with validation; `create` command and `play --name/--sex/--background/--nature/--aptitude/--track/--ambition`.
- CI compiles the Godot layer.
- **Fleets (first layer)**: `Fleet`/`FleetIntel` state, `FleetSystem` (transit, readiness, upkeep, incursions, intel),
  `MoveFleetCommand` / `RaiseFleetCommand`, `/content/fleets/rules.json`, scenario `fleets`, `fleetStrength`
  condition, NPC houses raise and sail, `GalaxyProjection.Fleets`; two fleet events (*Unfamiliar Sails*, *The Review*).
- **`CourtProjection`**: the Godot-free, tested model of everything Court mode shows; `CourtView` renders it.
- UI: Admiral panel, ship-laying buttons, fleet glyphs and movement orders on the map, serif/sans typography,
  portrait badge slot. NPC action pools gain one Treasury point a turn (fleet orders).
- **War & combat**: `War` state, `DeclareWarCommand` / `SueForPeaceCommand`, `atWar` condition, `declareWar` /
  `makePeace` effects; `FleetSystem.ResolveBattles` (hulls × readiness, defender + fortress/battery `defense`,
  seeded roll, losses, retreat) and `ResolveConquests` (an unopposed fleet in enemy space takes its holdings,
  `seizures`+1 for the player); NPC houses declare war when hostile and stronger, sue for peace when broken
  (the player answers through *The Envoy*). Four events: *The Butcher's Bill*, *The Conquered World*,
  *The Lost World*, *The Envoy*. War/peace buttons in the Court (Admiral) and on the map.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-11-07 — "headless complete"
See `docs/RELEASE_0.5.md` for the full notes.

### Added
- Save/load (`SaveSystem`, versioned envelope; `play --save/--load`).
- `track` and `era` conditions; `revokeClaim` and `succeed` effects; `{role.rankName}` token.
- Career ladders as data (`/content/careers`) with rank caps.
- Crisis `once` and `onResolve`.
- Stress bleed-off and break point (`broken`, `breakdowns`); regency flag; ironman vs continue mode (`--continue`).
- Population → Manpower with per-specialization ceilings; NPC houses invest in their domains.
- Scenario `the_imperial_court` (Imperium start); starting `flags` on scenario characters; married casts.
- 14 events: *The Favor Called*, *The Slighted Kinsman*, *The Frame Unravels*, three Imperial-court events, eight "echoes".
- CI runs the Python pre-flight validator; both validators reject events with no ungated choice.
- `version` command; `World.IsDynastyDead`; relationship index.

### Fixed
- Career events fired for the wrong track; ranks ran past the ladder top.
- Marriages authored from one spouse never produced heirs.
- The run continued after dynasty death.
- Four events had every choice gated and were re-offered forever.
- `press_the_claim` never spent its claim; `the_abdication` demoted the player's own house.
- `first_case/rule_by_favor` cleared `owes_you` instead of arming it; `the_marked_man/finish_it` killed no one.
- `realm_unstable` / `civil_war_active` never cleared.
- Content guide drift; duplicate upload artifacts at the repo root.

## [0.4] — 2026-06 — engine branch (pre-versioning)
Milestones 1, 2, 4 (economy), 5 and the dynasty lifecycle, headless. See `docs/MILESTONE_*_NOTES.md`.
